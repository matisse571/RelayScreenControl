# RelayScreenControl

This program turns the Wink Relay screen off and on based on the proximity sensor and screen touch.  I am not a programmer, so it has been cobbled together from various android samples online, and I am sure could be cleaned up by someone who knows what they are doing.  It requires root, and needs permissions changed on the sensor file and the gpio file to work.  The purpose of this program is to bypass the Wink software.
